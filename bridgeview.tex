\note{The project aims at generating BIM (Building Information Model)
  for existing bridges in an automatic way. This requires modelling
  the geometry and the materials of the bridge components. Material
  recognition from images is (relatively) solved. The challenge is on
  the geometry side.}
\note{\ldots which amounts to recognising for each bridge part what it
  represents and what shape it has, e.g.\ a column that has
  cylindrical shape. Once this info is available, a geometric fitting
  step is needed to get the parameters for each part. Due to the
  recent success of deep learning in various tasks like image
  labelling, object detection, semantic segmentation, we decided to
  use a deep learning based approach as well.}
